This report aims to investigate the factors influencing the number of shares for articles released on the Mashable website (www.mashable.com) over two years. To ensure the accuracy and quality of the data, a thorough cleaning process will be implemented on the dataset. Subsequently, an exploratory data analysis will be conducted to delve into the dataset's intricacies, summarising key features and exploring potential relationships between different attributes. After exploring the data, the report will develop a predictive model for the number of shares. These models will visually represent and forecast how different characteristics of articles impact share counts. The final sections of the report will present relevant business recommendations based on the findings and evaluate the performance of the descriptive and predictive models to determine which is more effective for understanding and predicting the sharing patterns of Mashable articles.
